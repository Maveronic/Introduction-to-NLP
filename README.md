## Sarcasm Detection in Sentiment Analysis

In the context of an Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, I focused on sentiment analysis, specifically the task of identifying sarcasm in text data.

This project involved the collection and preprocessing of a diverse dataset, including sarcastic remarks from various online sources. I utilized NLP tools and libraries for text transformation and employed feature engineering techniques to capture the nuances of sarcastic language.

The core of the project was the development of a sentiment analysis model tailored to detect sarcasm accurately. This model was rigorously evaluated using standard metrics, providing insights into its performance.

This GitHub project demonstrates my practical application of NLP techniques to the challenging task of sarcasm detection in sentiment analysis.
